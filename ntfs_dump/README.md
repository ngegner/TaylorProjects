# NTFS Parser
This program takes an image of an NTFS file system, and parses the boot sector and master file table sections. 

For each file in the system, it outputs the following attributes:
 - File name
- Full directory path
- File type
- Creation date
- Last modified date
- Allocated size of the file
- Actual size of the file
